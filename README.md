# fuwahex
A light hex viewer made as a learning project. For those wondering, "fuwa" refers to the Japanese term "fuwafuwa," meaning "light and airy". This project is inspired by the free hex editor Frhed: http://frhed.sourceforge.net/en/

NOTE: This is NOT meant to be a hex editor, merely a hex viewer.

## Project Goals
- Code a useful thing in JavaScript!
- Use the new ECMAScript 6 additions where they make sense (read: everywhere!)
- Get used to using transpilation (babel) and a module system (require.js)

## Desired Features
- Should be able to load a local file and view the file's bytes
- Resizable hexadecimal and UTF views for byte data
- Click a byte to highlight it in both views
- Scroll bar and seek functions to view the bytes you're interested in

## To Do
- Scroll bar and seek functions
- Resize data views via user-supplied row/column counts
- Look into removing excess files from the GitHub repository. Seriously, there are 5000 files in the nodemodules folder. I definitely don't use all of them.
